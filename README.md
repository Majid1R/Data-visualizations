# Data-visualizations
Several visualization scripts are available to assist you in accomplishing various data analysis objectives.

## 1. Scatter-Correlation Plot
A scatterplot is an essential tool for exploring the relationship between two methods. When your data involves some distinct methods that you want to visualize and compare, a scatterplot can effectively illustrate their similarities or differences. This code allows you to compare three different methods for illustration. The first element on the legend represents the x-axis, while the second element always represents the value on the y-axis.
