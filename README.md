# Data-visualizations
Several visualization scripts are available to assist you in accomplishing various data analysis objectives.

## Scatter-Correlation Plot
A scatterplot is an essential tool for exploring the relationship between two methods. When your data involves some distinct methods that you want to visualize and compare, a scatterplot can effectively illustrate their similarities or differences. This code allows you to compare three different methods for illustration. The first element on the legend represents the x-axis, while the second element always represents the value on the y-axis.

## Groupped barplots
A bar plot is a graphical method for presenting and comparing categorical data via rectangular bars. The height of each bar is proportional to the value of the category it signifies. Bar plots are extensively utilized to visualize comparative analyses across different groups or categories. Error bars are also added to bar plots to represent the variability or uncertainty of the data. We created a grouped bar plot to display four datasets side by side within each category. This arrangement allows for a direct comparison of the datasets across different categories.

## Violin-scatter plot
A violin scatter plot combines a violin plot and a scatter plot to visualize the distribution of a dataset while displaying individual data points. The violin plot shows the density distribution, with wider areas indicating higher data concentration, while the scatter plot overlays individual data points. Here, we have a violin scatter plot comparing three different time points or datasets across two different methods or groups. You can adjust the number of data points as needed.
