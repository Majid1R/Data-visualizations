# Data-visualizations
Several visualization scripts are available to assist you in accomplishing various data analysis objectives.

## Scatter-Correlation Plot
A scatterplot is an essential tool for exploring the relationship between two methods. When your data involves some distinct methods that you want to visualize and compare, a scatterplot can effectively illustrate their similarities or differences. This code allows you to compare three different methods for illustration. The first element on the legend represents the x-axis, while the second element always represents the value on the y-axis.

## Barplots
A bar plot is a graphical method for presenting and comparing categorical data via rectangular bars. The height of each bar is proportional to the value of the category it signifies. Bar plots are extensively utilized to visualize comparative analyses across different groups or categories. Error bars are also added to bar plots to represent the variability or uncertainty of the data. We created a grouped bar plot to display four datasets side by side within each category. This arrangement allows for a direct comparison of the datasets across different categories.

## Violin-scatter plot
A violin scatter plot combines a violin plot and a scatter plot to visualize the distribution of a dataset while displaying individual data points. The violin plot shows the density distribution, with wider areas indicating higher data concentration, while the scatter plot overlays individual data points. Here, we have a violin scatter plot comparing three different time points or datasets across two different methods or groups. You can adjust the number of data points as needed.

## Boxplots
A Box-Plot, also known as a whisker plot, is a statistical visualization used to summarize the distribution of a dataset. It displays the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the data. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data, while the line inside the box marks the median. Box-plots are useful for comparing distributions, identifying variability, and spotting outliers. Here, we presented multiple groups, allowing for the comparison of two different methods or parameters within each group.

## Grouped Scatter-Plot
A Grouped Scatter-Plot is a visualization that displays multiple scatter plots within a single figure, allowing comparisons across different groups or categories. Each plot represents a specific dataset or subset, with data points typically differentiated by color. By grouping these plots together in one figure, it becomes easier to compare patterns
